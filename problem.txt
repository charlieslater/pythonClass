The file, sample.txt is a excerpt from "Mule Bone", a play by
Langston Hughes.  The goal of this probem is to count unique words.
To make it easier, I have removed punctuation and converted all
letters to lowercase.  Compute the following:

1. The number of unique words in the file
2. The number of times each word appears in the file
